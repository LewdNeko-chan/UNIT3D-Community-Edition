    | Blacklist Clients
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | An array of clients to be blacklisted which will reject them from announcing
    | to the sites tracker.
    |
    | clients -> Please use Regex. this is to blacklist multiple clients in a fast way.
	| For example, to blacklist only the client "bittorrent" add this following: '/^bittorrent$/'
	| this means, exactly match bittorrent first of all, / at the beginning and /[modifyer, normaly i for case unsensitive]
	| then after this, in that example here, the ^ means that this is the first position of the string, so nothing before
	| the letter "b...". the $ at the end of the string means, that nothing shoud follow in this string. so that the string must end
	| on "...t". for example, we want to blacklist all instances of "uglyclient/123.413.221" we must add
	| we can do this by adding following rule: "/^(uglyclient)\/[0-9\.]+$/i"
	| the "\" before the "/" and "." is needed for escaping. so, that means "uglyclient/6564.342.2346.2234.222.52" will also be blocked.
